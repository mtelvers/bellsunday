---

Having commissioned a peal board following the successful peal rung last
May for the coronation of His Royal Highness King Charles lll, we agreed
with our Vicar, who also happens to be a bell ringer, to dedicate the
peal board at the main 10am service this morning. All the ringers who
were able to attend the service came to the front, two of them holding
the board as the Vicar dedicated it. Before doing so, he thanked the
ringers publicly for ringing the bells week in week out. We also had
ringers read the two lesions at the service.

For around the last four or five years, we have celebrated the work of
the ringers in church in February, with ringing related hymns and
ringers reading the lesson and taking the offertory up as well as a
brief talk around bell ringing during the sermon slot.
